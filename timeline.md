# Project Timeline: AI YouTube Summarizer

This timeline outlines the development phases of the AI YouTube Summarizer project, based on the agile methodology described in the project documentation. The project was developed as an academic minor project, spanning approximately 5 months from inception to completion.

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis (Month 1)
- **Duration**: Weeks 1-4
- **Activities**:
  - Identify user needs for content summarization
  - Analyze existing tools and technologies
  - Define system requirements (hardware/software)
  - Create use case and activity diagrams
- **Deliverables**: Requirements specification, initial diagrams

## Phase 2: Design Phase (Month 2)
- **Duration**: Weeks 5-8
- **Activities**:
  - Design system architecture (extension, frontend, backend)
  - Select technology stack (React, Flask, Hugging Face API)
  - Create detailed component designs
  - Plan API endpoints and data flow
- **Deliverables**: System architecture diagram, technology stack documentation

## Phase 3: Implementation (Months 3-4)
- **Duration**: Weeks 9-16
- **Activities**:
  - **Backend Development** (Weeks 9-12):
    - Set up Flask API
    - Implement summarization endpoints
    - Integrate Hugging Face API
    - Add translation support
  - **Frontend Development** (Weeks 13-14):
    - Create React web interface
    - Implement content input forms
    - Add Axios for API communication
  - **Extension Development** (Weeks 15-16):
    - Develop Chrome extension (Manifest V3)
    - Implement YouTube integration
    - Create popup interface
- **Deliverables**: Functional backend API, React app, Chrome extension

## Phase 4: Integration (Month 5, Weeks 17-18)
- **Duration**: Weeks 17-18
- **Activities**:
  - Combine frontend, backend, and extension components
  - Ensure seamless communication between components
  - Resolve cross-origin and CORS issues
  - Test end-to-end functionality
- **Deliverables**: Integrated system

## Phase 5: Testing (Month 5, Weeks 19-20)
- **Duration**: Weeks 19-20
- **Activities**:
  - Unit testing of individual components
  - Integration testing
  - Performance testing (response times, accuracy)
  - User acceptance testing
  - Bug fixing and error handling improvements
- **Deliverables**: Tested, stable system

## Phase 6: Deployment and Documentation (Month 5, Weeks 21-22)
- **Duration**: Weeks 21-22
- **Activities**:
  - Prepare installation guides
  - Write README and documentation
  - Create project report and research paper
  - Final deployment preparations
- **Deliverables**: Complete project documentation, deployable system

## Key Milestones
- **Week 4**: Requirements finalized
- **Week 8**: Design completed
- **Week 16**: Core implementation finished
